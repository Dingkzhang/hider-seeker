After taking into consideration the amount of time I spend right now, I figured that it would take much longer to build a better site. I am going to update the plan and have the second sprint be focused on writing features for my site. For the rest of this sprint, I will be figuring out what API calls and functions that I will need in order to successfully communicate between my frontend and backend."
